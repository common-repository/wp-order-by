Simple and easy way to order your posts, pages or any other custom post-type in a various options, with the ability to define a different order option for each content type.

A new menu will appear on the admin side-menu under each content type that is defined on your site (posts, pages etc.) and it will also be added automatically to future custom post types you will add in the future. 
In addition, under the *Settings* menu in WordPress you will find a general settings sub-menu to set global options for the plugin.

== Frequently Asked Questions ==
= What if I want to retrieve settings to default? =

You should update your settings to the first option - *Date* and check the *Descending* order radio button, which is WordPress default ordering.
You can make the update for a specific content type (e.g. posts) or from the main settings page under *settings -> WP Order By Settings*  if you want to make the change for all page/post/post-types on your site.
